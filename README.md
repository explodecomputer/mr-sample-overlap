# Weak instrument bias

How much does sample overlap induce bias?

**Vary:**

- Confounding values
- Instrument strength
- Sample overlap

**Compare:**

- Observational estimates
- MR estimates (Wald ratios)

**Scenarios 1:**

- GWAS discovery: sample1
- Exposure: sample1
- Outcome: sample1

**Scenario 2:**

- GWAS discovery: sample1
- Exposure: sample1
- Outcome: sample2

**Scenario 3:**

- GWAS discovery: sample1
- Exposure: sample2
- Outcome: sample2

**Scenario 4:**

- GWAS discovery: sample1
- Exposure: sample2
- Outcome: sample3


Scenarios 1 and 2 are extreme versions of 3 and 4, in which winner's curse will be exaggerated.
